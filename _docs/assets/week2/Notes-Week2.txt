>> Odds-n-Ends

	* Strange. With file package-lock.json located at /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/package-lock.json
        GitPod workspace alerts that this file is untracked. Gives the option to commit file to GitHub.
        Not sure if I should.

>> Honeycomb

	* ui.honeycomb.io

	* API_cruddur_key : qFpPcYYEvC7MeIX3lzL4lD	

	* API Key         : 0HKiS7w83W5ZNalGjQvbxA

	* OTEL is short for Open Telemetry

	* Need to export with

		$ export HONEYCOMB_API_KEY="qFpPcYYEvC7MeIX3lzL4lD"


>> GitPod

	* gp env sets persistent environmental variables that are not lost (erased) upon restarting GitPod workspace.

     * To unset an environment variable in GitPod, use the following cammand:

		$ unset {name of variable}

		Example)  $ unset HONEY_COMB_API_KEY   

	* In GitPod the syntax ${name of environment variable} in a yml file, is how GitPod loads (references) into a
       a docker file.

	* After commiting code to GitHub, and you get Sync errors, do a "push" by entering the following at the prompt. 

		$ git push
  
     * When done with your workspace, be sure to tag the work you have done for the week by entering:

		$ git tag week-x
		$ git push --tags


>> Docker Commands

		$ docker compose -f "docker-compose.yml" down
